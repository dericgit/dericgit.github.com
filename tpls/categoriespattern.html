Categories Of Design Pattern
</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A glossary from the well-known design book, <em>Domain-Driven Terms</em>, rightly states that:</p>
<p><i>“A design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable object-oriented design. The design pattern identifies the participating classes and their instances, their roles and collaborations, and the distribution of responsibilities. </i></p>
<p><i>Each design pattern focuses on a particular object-oriented design problem or issue. It describes when it applies, whether or not it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of its use. Since we must eventually implement our designs, a design pattern also provides sample ... code to illustrate an implementation. </i></p>
<p><i>Although design patterns describe object-oriented designs, they are based on practical solutions that have been implemented in mainstream object-oriented programming languages ....”</i></p>
<p>Design patterns can be broken down into a number of different categories. In this section we’ll review three of these categories and briefly mention a few examples of the patterns that fall into these categories before exploring specific ones in more detail.

<h2>Creational Design Patterns</h2>
<p>
</p><p>Creational design patterns focus on handling object creation mechanisms where objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation we're working in. The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project whilst these patterns aim to solve this problem by <em>controlling</em> the creation process.</p>
<p>Some of the patterns that fall under this category are: Constructor, Factory, Abstract, Prototype, Singleton and Builder.</p>
<h2>Structural Design Patterns</h2>
<p>Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships between different objects. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn't need to do the same. They also assist in recasting parts of the system which don't fit a particular purpose into those that do. </p>
<p>Patterns that fall under this category include: Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Adapter and Proxy.</p>
<h2>Behavioral Design Patterns</h2>
<p>Behavioral patterns focus on improving or streamlining the communication between disparate objects in a system.</p>
<p>Some behavioral patterns include: Iterator, Mediator, Observer and Visitor.</p>
